`utils/create_dirpaths.py` creates the directory paths to run the pipeline. 


There are several options, either you can run directly

```
python utils/create_datapaths.py
```

Or create another configuration file inside `conf/datapaths` and run

```
python utils/create_datapaths.py datapaths=<configuration yaml>
```
